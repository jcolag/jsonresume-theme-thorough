# jsonresume-theme-thorough
Placeholder experiment with Handlebars.js

In short, a while back, a former colleague asked for some help getting their [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) rendered in a way that uses the entire schema and looks clean when exported to PDF.  I based it on the existing [boilerplate](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) theme.
